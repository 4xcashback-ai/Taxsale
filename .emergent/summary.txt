The previous AI engineer successfully transformed a basic Nova Scotia Tax Sale Aggregator into a robust application. The journey involved iterative development, deep debugging, and significant feature additions. Key initial efforts focused on enhancing Halifax PDF scraping for accurate data extraction and enriching property details with external links and an interactive map.

A major part of the work addressed user experience and data accuracy. This included implementing comprehensive municipality management (add, edit, delete, scheduling), integrating Google Maps (replacing Leaflet) for property visualization, and meticulous debugging of map functionalities (crashes, zoom, data display). Crucially, the engineer tackled a persistent challenge: accurate property boundary visualization. After initial attempts with Viewpoint.ca failed due to accessibility, the focus shifted to leveraging official Nova Scotia Government ArcGIS data. This involved discovering the correct NS GIS service, integrating it to retrieve precise property boundaries, and then successfully combining this data with Google Maps Static API to generate high-quality satellite thumbnails with property lines. The work culminated in starting the integration of these NSPRD boundaries onto the live interactive map.

<product_requirements>
The core product goal is a web application aggregating Nova Scotia tax sale information, displaying it in a searchable and map-based format with weekly updates.

**Key Features & Enhancements Implemented:**
*   **Robust Halifax Scraper:** Automatically finds, downloads, and parses Halifax tax sale PDFs, extracting detailed property information (Owner Names, PIDs, Opening Bids, Redeemable/HST status, assessment numbers). This involved extensive debugging for data accuracy and handling various PDF structures.
*   **Interactive Mapping:** Integrated Google Maps (replacing ) to display properties, including custom markers, detailed info windows, and precise locations through Google Geocoding.
*   **Property Details Page:** Dedicated page for each property showing comprehensive details, PVSC-scraped data, and embedded Google Maps. External links to PVSC and Viewpoint.ca are accurate.
*   **Property Status Management:** Active/inactive property statuses with frontend filtering and display.
*   **Enhanced Statistics & Admin:** Displays summary statistics (total, active, inactive properties, municipalities) and an Admin panel for adding, editing, and deleting municipalities, including setting scraping schedules.
*   **Accurate Property Boundaries:** Integrated official Nova Scotia Government ArcGIS Tax Parcels data to retrieve precise property boundaries (polygons). These boundaries are used to generate satellite image thumbnails (via Google Maps Static API) which are displayed in search results and property detail pages, providing real-world property visualization.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on integrating the official Nova Scotia Property Registration Database (NSPRD) property boundaries as an overlay on the main interactive Google Map in the frontend.

Specifically, the engineer had just made modifications to  to enhance the Google Maps component. The goal is to fetch the precise polygon geometry for tax sale properties from the Nova Scotia government's ArcGIS service (which was successfully integrated and tested in the backend) and render these polygons directly on the live map, allowing users to visualize the exact boundaries of all listed properties.

The last action recorded was: Now let me restart the frontend to apply the enhanced live map with NSPRD boundary overlays. This indicates that the code changes for the overlay in  have been made, and the next step is to observe their effect in the UI.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Restart the frontend to apply the changes and verify that NSPRD property boundary overlays are correctly displayed on the live Google Map.
