The trajectory details a complex debugging and feature implementation journey for the Tax Sale Compass application. Initially, the AI engineer focused on resolving a hardcoded scraper routing bug for Cumberland County, followed by attempts to fix a non-functional deploy button on the live site. This led to extensive troubleshooting of environment variable loading for the Google Maps API key in the backend, then frontend UX improvements for the deployment process, and finally, a persistent problem with the Google Maps API key not being picked up by the frontend build, causing interactive map and thumbnail issues. The latest efforts concentrated on correcting static file serving in the backend, which was incorrectly returning HTML instead of images for property boundaries. The AI navigated through multiple environment-specific issues (development vs. VPS), git conflicts, and service management differences (Supervisor vs. PM2).

<product_requirements>
The Tax Sale Compass application aims to centralize Nova Scotia tax sale data, offering an interactive map, PDF scraping, and property filtering for users. Key features include Google AdSense, an admin interface for managing municipalities and scrapers, and in-app deployment automation. The application supports multiple PIDs, tracks auction results, and incorporates a smart scheduler. It provides free and paid user tiers, with detailed property access requiring an account. Recent enhancements and fixes included restoring PVSC assessment info, ensuring admin users are marked as paid subscribers, accurate display of Victoria County property statuses, province tracking with dynamic flags, and robust scraper scheduling. A significant beta feature was the Favorites List for paid users, complete with thumbnails, public favorite counts, and add/remove functionality. Critical bug fixes included displaying public auction instead of public tender for Cumberland County properties and ensuring its specific scraper functioned correctly in production.

<code_architecture>


- ****:
    - **Importance**: Core FastAPI application, API endpoints, and database interactions. Also contains backend deployment logic and environment variable loading.
    - **Changes Made**:
        - Fixed hardcoded scraping logic for  to use dynamic .
        - Added  to  to ensure environment variables are loaded correctly in local environment.
        - Modified the  logic and all hardcoded  paths to dynamically resolve to  on the VPS.
        - Enabled the static file serving by uncommenting .

- ****:
    - **Importance**: Main React component for global state, routing, and UI.
    - **Changes Made**:
        - Enhanced deployment management UI feedback (detailed messages, loading indicators, auto-refresh).
        - Implemented  persistence for the GitHub repository URL in the deployment section, pre-filling and auto-saving it.

- ****:
    - **Importance**: Likely handles property search and static map image generation.
    - **Changes Made**: Added a fallback API key  to the Google Static Maps URL construction ().

- **Usage: /app/scripts/deployment.sh {deploy|check-updates|rollback|verify} [github-repo-url]

Commands:
  deploy [repo-url]    - Deploy latest code from GitHub
  check-updates        - Check if updates are available
  rollback [backup]    - Rollback to a specific backup
  verify              - Verify current deployment

Examples:
  /app/scripts/deployment.sh deploy https://github.com/user/nstaxsales.git
  /app/scripts/deployment.sh check-updates
  /app/scripts/deployment.sh verify**:
    - **Importance**: Shell script used by the backend API to automate deployment tasks (git pull, build, restart).
    - **Changes Made**:
        - Updated  and  variables from  to  for correct VPS path detection.
        - Corrected PM2 service names from  references to  and .
        - Fixed example URL references.

- ****:
    - **Importance**: Stores frontend-specific environment variables.
    - **Changes Made**: Updated  to . (Verified on VPS but needs to be picked up by build).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was addressing a critical bug where property thumbnails and interactive maps were not displaying correctly, specifically that boundary images were not loading. The root cause was identified as the backend's static file serving being misconfigured. Although the directory for static files existed and contained the images, the FastAPI  line was either commented out or incorrectly configured, leading to the server returning  (HTML content) instead of  when requesting image files directly. The AI engineer's action was to uncomment and update the static file mounting configuration in  to ensure it uses the correct absolute path  for serving static assets. This change was followed by a restart of the backend service via PM2. The goal of this fix is to correctly serve property boundary images so they can be displayed on the frontend, resolving the  content type issue for images.

<optional_next_step>
Verify if the static file serving is now correctly returning  for boundary images.
