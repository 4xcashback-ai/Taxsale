The AI engineer successfully built a Nova Scotia Tax Sale Aggregator application, moving from initial MVP to a feature-rich state. Key work involved robust Halifax PDF scraping, which was a multi-stage process riddled with data extraction and parsing challenges, especially regarding property descriptions and redeemable/HST status. The engineer meticulously debugged truncation issues, incorrect field assignments, and execution flow problems (identified by the troubleshoot agent).

Post-scraping, the focus shifted to enhancing the user experience. This included developing a detailed property page, fixing external links to PVSC and Viewpoint.ca, integrating Google Maps for precise location, and removing internal database IDs from display. Finally, a comprehensive property status management system was implemented, allowing for active/inactive filtering and displaying these statistics in the application header, along with municipality management features. The immediate task involves fixing the municipality management form's API call.

<product_requirements>
The core product goal is a web application aggregating Nova Scotia tax sale information, displaying it in a searchable and map-based format with weekly updates.

**Initial Requirements:**
*   Scrape tax sale data from all Nova Scotia municipalities.
*   Display data via search and an interactive map.
*   Weekly data updates.

**Implemented Enhancements & Bug Fixes:**
*   **Halifax Scraper:** Implemented a robust PDF scraper to automatically find, download, and parse Halifax tax sale PDFs, extracting Owner Names, Property Descriptions, PIDs, Opening Bids, Redeemable status, and HST status. This required extensive debugging for accurate data extraction, handling truncation, and correct field mapping.
*   **Interactive Map:** Integrated  (later replaced by Google Maps) to display properties.
*   **External Links:** Properties link to PVSC (Property Valuation Services Corporation) for assessment details, Viewpoint.ca for specific property pages (by PID), and municipal websites for tax sale pages. These links were extensively debugged to ensure correct URLs and specific property navigation.
*   **Property Details Page:** Created a dedicated page for each property, showing comprehensive details, financial information, legal descriptions, and integrated Google Maps location.
*   **Property Status Management:** Implemented active/inactive status for properties based on sale dates or removal from listings, with frontend filtering options and status badges.
*   **Enhanced Statistics & Admin:** Displayed summary statistics (total, active, inactive properties, municipalities) in the header. Added functionality to the Admin panel to add and edit municipalities.

<current_work>
The AI engineer was immediately working on fixing a bug in the municipality management section of the Admin panel. The user reported that the management is not active to save.

Upon investigation, the engineer discovered the frontend was sending the wrong field name () to the backend API when attempting to add or edit a municipality. The backend  Pydantic model in  explicitly requires a  field. This mismatch led to a  (Unprocessable Entity) error from the backend.

The engineer made several edits to  to correct this:
1.  Updated the form's state variable and input field to correctly reference  as .
2.  Modified the  and  functions to ensure they send  in the API payload, aligning with the backend's expected schema.
3.  Adjusted the form reset logic to properly clear the  field.

The immediate next step is to test this fixed municipality API endpoint to confirm that adding and editing municipalities now works correctly.
