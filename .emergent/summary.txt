The AI engineer successfully transformed the Nova Scotia Tax Sale Aggregator from an MVP to a more robust application. Initial development focused on core features like PDF scraping, Google Maps integration, and municipality management, addressing several deployment and PM2 configuration issues. A significant portion of the work involved meticulously refining the frontend UI/UX, particularly the property details page layout with a right sidebar, and re-implementing the interactive map with NSPRD boundaries after several debugging iterations. Multi-municipality scraping was introduced, and critical deployment-related backend URL and CORS issues were resolved. The latest efforts focused on displaying comprehensive PVSC assessment data on the property details page, which led to debugging persistent server-side integration problems where scraped data wasn't fully propagating to the API response. The engineer demonstrated a systematic approach to identifying and resolving complex, multi-layered bugs across the stack.

The Nova Scotia Tax Sale Aggregator aims to centralize and display weekly Nova Scotia tax sale information on an interactive map. Key features include a robust Halifax PDF scraper, Google Maps integration showing properties with custom markers and precise NSPRD boundaries, and detailed property pages. Users can filter properties, and administrators can manage municipalities, setting scraping schedules and types. Monetization is achieved via Google AdSense.

So far, the application has been enhanced to:
1.  **Display comprehensive property details**: Includes status, sale type, dates, address, AAN, PID, property size, and detailed PVSC assessment data (Building Style, Year Built, Total Living Area, Bedrooms, Baths, Land Size).
2.  **Provide an interactive map**: On property details pages, showing NSPRD boundary polygons with dynamically centered markers.
3.  **Offer enhanced search functionality**: With filters and boundary thumbnails displayed on search results.
4.  **Integrate dynamic external links**: Tax sale buttons fetch municipality-specific URLs from the database.
5.  **Restore Google AdSense**: On both search and property detail pages.
6.  **Support multi-municipality scraping**: For Cape Breton and Kentville.
7.  **Ensure robust deployment**: By fixing backend URL references and CORS policies.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Core FastAPI application for API routes, MongoDB interaction, web scraping, and task scheduling. Manages  and  models.
    -   **Changes Made**: Enhanced models, updated CRUD, integrated Google Geocoding/ArcGIS, added image/boundary endpoints. Scraper dispatch logic now respects . Added specific scrapers and endpoints for Cape Breton and Kentville. Implemented Google Maps Static API for boundary thumbnail generation. Fixed  endpoint routing. Updated CORS to include production domains.  was modified to capture additional fields (building_style, living_area, quality_of_construction, under_construction, living_units, finished_basement, garage), but data return remains an issue.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Main React component managing layout, routing, global state, and data fetching for property display and municipality administration.
    -   **Changes Made**: Updated municipality state, , and integrated . Refactored routing for dedicated pages. Re-added search functionality (input, filters) to the UI. Confirmed and utilized  for search page thumbnails. Updated  in  and hardcoded fallbacks in the code. Re-integrated  into the search results grid.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Displays detailed information for a single property.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently debugging a persistent server-side integration issue with the PVSC data. The  function in  was enhanced to capture additional fields (Quality of Construction, Under Construction, Living Units, Finished Basement, Garage) from the PVSC website. Backend testing confirmed that the scraping function *successfully finds and extracts* these new fields. However, these fields are *not* being included in the final API response from . The engineer attempted to fix a suspected async/await issue in the backend's data handling. The last backend test after this fix () still reported No PVSC data returned for these specific fields, indicating the issue persists despite the scraping logic itself working. The user's last input was go, signaling to continue troubleshooting this problem.

<optional_next_step>
Debug the backend to ensure all PVSC fields scraped by  are returned in the enhanced property API response.
