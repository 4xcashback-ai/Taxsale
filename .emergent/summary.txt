The AI engineer successfully addressed multiple critical bugs and feature requests. Initially, the focus was on fixing search page thumbnail loading, evolving from a simple path issue to complex database, file system, and Nginx configuration debugging. This led to implementing dynamic boundary overlays using a triangle corner detection algorithm and dynamic zoom. Subsequently, the engineer tackled robust handling of multi-PID properties, Mobile Home Only classifications, and extraction of auction date/type from both webpages and PDFs. The conversation also involved extensive database migration debugging due to MySQL version incompatibilities and existing data conflicts, culminating in a robust admin panel for managing PIDs, auction data, and scraper testing, all while maintaining a focus on  properties only.

<product_requirements>
The Tax Sale Compass application centralizes Canada-wide tax sale data, featuring an interactive map, PDF scraping, and property filtering under a tiered subscription model. Key requirements include robust web scraping for PVSC data, accurate property status management, reliable deployments, and an interactive UI with property boundary overlays via Google Maps. The application uses a PHP frontend, Python FastAPI backend, and MySQL database. Recent enhancements include: a functional property boundary thumbnail system with dynamic zoom and accurate outlines, a comprehensive web-safe deployment mechanism, robust handling of properties with multiple PIDs, specific Mobile Home Only classifications, and extraction/display of auction dates and types. The admin panel now supports managing missing PIDs, scraper testing, and bulk updating auction information for active properties.

The application employs a standard LAMP-like stack augmented with a Python FastAPI backend.



-   ****: Core FastAPI API endpoints. Updated to provide property boundary data from Nova Scotia ArcGIS, crucial for thumbnail generation.
-   ****: Generates Google Maps Static API images. Heavily modified to first check the  in DB, then generate images with property boundary overlays using dynamic zoom and triangle corner detection from backend API data. Includes robust file saving and directory permission handling.
-   ****: Frontend search page. Modified to retrieve  from DB, display dynamic PID information (multi-PID, mobile home only), display  and , include cache busting for thumbnails, and allow searching by . Debugging code was added and later refined.
-   ****: Admin panel. Enhanced with dedicated sections for , ,  (reset recent scraping), and  (municipality-based bulk updates for active properties). Includes JavaScript for real-time interaction.
-   ****: API endpoint to manually trigger batch thumbnail generation, using the updated logic.
-   ** (New)**: API to list properties without PIDs and allow manual editing or rescanning flags.
-   ** (New)**: API to reset recently scraped properties for re-testing scraper logic.
-   ** (New)**: API for municipality-based bulk updates of auction type and sale date for active properties.
-   ****: SQL migration. Adds  column to  table.
-   ** (New)**: SQL migration. Adds , , ,  columns to . Includes safe migration logic for existing data and MySQL version compatibility for index creation and enum updates.
-   ** (New)**: SQL migration. Adds  and  columns to . Includes safe migration logic.
-   ****: Script for batch generation of thumbnails. Updated to use the new triangle corner detection algorithm, dynamic zoom, and  naming convention.

<pending_tasks>
- Complete the Admin Configuration Panel for editable scraper parameters.
- Fine-tune Nginx and PHP-FPM for optimal performance.
- Address minor address parsing issues for specific properties (though broad improvements have been made).
- Ensure all scrapers (Victoria, Cumberland) are fully functional and extracting data accurately, not just Halifax.
- Set up monitoring and logging for production use beyond the deployment console.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer successfully implemented robust handling for complex property data and auction information. This involved fixing several database migration errors (, , ) by creating a safer  script that gracefully updates schema and data (converting 'Dwelling' to 'mixed', 'Land'/'Unknown' to 'land') while being compatible with the existing MySQL version. The scraper () was also refined to correctly parse property types (e.g., Dwelling -> mixed, Mobile Home Only -> mobile_home_only) from address descriptions and handle multiple PID numbers. The database layer () and search page () were updated to support and display these new data structures. Additionally, an Auction Information Management section was added to the admin panel (, ) for bulk updates of auction type and sale date, specifically targeting active properties within a selected municipality. The database migration for  was also prepared.

<optional_next_step>
Restart the backend service, then test a scraping run and check the search page displays for new features.
