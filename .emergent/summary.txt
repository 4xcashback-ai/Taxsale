The previous AI engineer's trajectory involved extensive debugging and feature enhancement for the Tax Sale Compass application. Initial efforts resolved PM2 configuration issues,  dependency errors, and Nginx routing problems, culminating in both frontend and backend services being operational and accessible via . Admin login was transitioned from environment variables to database-based authentication, with a user-creation script provided. A major bug involving generic property boundary thumbnails was fixed by generating specific images using Google Maps Static API and correctly linking them in the MongoDB  collection. The most recent focus has been on automating this boundary generation within the scraping process for Victoria, Halifax, and Cumberland counties, and adding administrative tools for force regeneration, specifically for *active* properties. The work was interrupted as the AI was about to update the admin endpoint for this active properties only logic.

<product_requirements>
The Tax Sale Compass application centralizes Nova Scotia tax sale data, offering an interactive map, PDF scraping, and robust property filtering. Key features include Google AdSense integration, an admin interface with in-app deployment, support for multiple PIDs, auction result tracking, and a smart scheduler. It provides free and paid user tiers, with detailed property access for paid subscribers and a Favorites List beta for paid users. Recent development has focused on restoring PVSC assessment information, accurate property status display, province tracking, and improving scraper scheduling reliability. Crucial efforts addressed deployment optimization, database performance, clean error logging, and UI discrepancies like missing property boundary overlays on thumbnails and an incorrect updates available notification. The user explicitly prefers the interactive Google Maps and original boundary overlay thumbnails, as they proved reliable in the development environment.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was focused on enhancing the automation of boundary image generation for the Tax Sale Compass application. Following user feedback, the AI had just finished modifying the core backend code () to integrate automatic boundary thumbnail generation directly into the scraping process for Victoria, Halifax, and Cumberland counties. This ensures that when new properties are scraped, their boundary images are generated and linked in the database without manual intervention.

Furthermore, new API endpoints were added for administrative control, allowing for manual force regeneration of these boundary images. The latest user feedback specifically requested that the action button in the admin for whole municipaltie should only focuse on active properties. The AI successfully implemented this logic, editing the code to ensure that bulk boundary regeneration for a municipality only applies to properties with an active status. The very last action was the AI stating its intention to update the admin endpoint to reflect this active properties only change for the bulk generation feature.
