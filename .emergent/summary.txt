The trajectory details the evolution of the Nova Scotia Tax Sale Aggregator, spanning from core feature development to complex deployment. The previous AI engineer focused on enhancing Halifax PDF scraping, integrating Google Maps with precise NSPRD property boundaries, and developing robust municipality management. Key challenges included debugging map overlays, ensuring accurate marker alignment, and addressing deployment-specific issues like Node.js compatibility and Nginx configuration on a VPS. AdSense integration for revenue generation was also implemented across multiple pages. The work has transitioned to ongoing debugging on a VPS, specifically regarding scraping status updates and the Halifax Live button functionality.

<product_requirements>
The application's core goal is to aggregate Nova Scotia tax sale information, presenting it in a searchable, map-based format with weekly updates.
**Implemented Features & Enhancements:**
*   **Halifax Scraper:** Robust PDF scraping extracts property details (Owner, PIDs, Bids, etc.).
*   **Interactive Mapping (Google Maps):** Displays properties with custom markers, info windows, precise locations via Google Geocoding, and official Nova Scotia Government ArcGIS (NSPRD) property boundaries as overlays. Markers are aligned with boundary centers for accuracy.
*   **Property Details Page:** Shows comprehensive property data, PVSC links, and a satellite boundary image.
*   **Property Status Management:** Active/inactive status with frontend filtering.
*   **Admin Panel:** CRUD for municipalities, including setting scraping schedules (frequency, day, time, scraper type).
*   **Google AdSense Integration:** Ads displayed on property detail pages (below bid box) and search results (after every 5 properties).

<pending_tasks>
-   Complete the implementation of NSPRD property boundary overlays on the main live Google Map view in  (this was done and verified in preview, but needs verification on VPS).
-   Implement scraping for other Nova Scotia municipalities using the established generic scraper framework.
-   Implement email alerts for new tax sales.
-   Implement property history tracking and analytics.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the focus was on debugging issues encountered during the deployment of the application to a VPS. The main problems reported by the user are:
1.  **Scraping status not updating on the frontend after clicking Scrape All** on the VPS. While the backend scraping itself was confirmed to work in the Emergent preview environment (and produces 62 properties for Halifax), the frontend UI on the VPS does not reflect the success status for municipalities.
2.  **Halifax Live button failing on the VPS.** This suggests a specific issue with triggering the Halifax scraper through the frontend UI on the VPS, even though a direct  command to  works.

The previous actions involved verifying backend logs, manually testing scraping endpoints via  on the VPS (which indicated the backend logic is sound), and checking frontend environment variables and build status. The core issue seems to lie in the communication or state updates between the frontend and backend on the deployed VPS environment.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
I will start by re-verifying the VPS frontend build and backend logs during a frontend-triggered scrape.
