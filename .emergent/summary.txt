The trajectory details the AI engineer's efforts on the Tax Sale Compass application. Initially, it involved fixing a multi-PID backend logic error (bbox format) and frontend connection issues (). This was successfully resolved. Subsequently, the focus shifted to implementing a sophisticated auction result management system with , , , and  statuses, including smart scheduling and an admin UI. After resolving UI/filtering bugs related to these statuses, a major task was initiated: building a comprehensive landing page with user authentication, subscription tiers, and email verification (SendGrid). During this integration, the AI made a critical error by completely rewriting , destroying existing functional components like interactive maps, image displays, and the full admin panel. The latter part of the trajectory details the apology and the painstaking process of restoring these lost functionalities and fixing recurring frontend URL/API prefix issues, culminating in a functional, but not yet perfectly integrated, development environment. The AI recognized the user's live site was working perfectly, prompting a critical review of the development strategy.

The Tax Sale Compass application aims to centralize Nova Scotia tax sale data, providing an interactive map, PDF scraping, property filtering, Google Maps integration, and detailed property pages. It includes Google AdSense for monetization and an admin interface for municipality management and scraping. Recent enhancements focused on dynamic external links and municipality-specific descriptions. A core feature was an in-app deployment automation from the admin page. The AI engineer was tasked with debugging this automation, fixing  errors, malformed image URLs, No updates available discrepancies, and implementing robust admin authentication to create a bulletproof deployment system. The latest task involved enhancing property data handling for multiple Parcel Identification Numbers (PIDs) for combined display on maps. Further requests included implementing an enhanced auction status system (, /, , , , ), tracking winning bids, and a smart scheduler for automatic status updates. Finally, a comprehensive landing page (like TaxSalesHub.ca) with user accounts (free/paid tiers), displaying limited properties/thumbnails, and requiring account creation for detailed views was requested. Free users should view all listings and inactive property details, paid users access all properties and details, and admin users access everything.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was addressing layout issues in the admin panel of the development environment. The user reported that the admin panel cards were displaying vertically instead of horizontally. The AI implemented a fix in  to ensure these cards adopt a horizontal layout on all screen sizes. This was part of a larger effort to restore functionality that was accidentally removed during a previous major refactor of  for the new landing page and user authentication system. The AI had just completed the horizontal layout fix and was preparing to verify it with a screenshot, but the automated test encountered an authentication session expiration, returning to the landing page.

The overall  revolves around successfully integrating the newly developed landing page, user registration/login, and subscription-based access control with the previously existing and fully functional Tax Sale Compass application. This has involved extensive debugging of frontend API calls (ensuring  prefix and correct  backend URL), restoring accidentally deleted components (like the interactive map and image display), and re-implementing missing admin panel features. The AI has also identified that the user's live site () is working perfectly with 65 active properties, images, and a clean layout, which contrasts with the instability encountered in the development environment due to the AI's previous actions. The AI is now at a point where it has restored much of the core functionality but is keenly aware of the risk to the live site and is seeking user guidance on the next steps to ensure a safe integration strategy.
