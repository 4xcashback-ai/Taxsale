<analysis>
The AI engineer's work primarily focused on stabilizing and enhancing the Tax Sale Compass application, moving from a basic MVP to a more robust, production-ready system. Initial efforts concentrated on implementing and debugging an in-app deployment automation feature, resolving critical  errors by refactoring backend subprocess calls to direct HTTP requests. Subsequently, significant time was spent fixing persistent UI and routing issues, including double-encoded property image URLs and frontend display inconsistencies for deployment statuses and scraper types. A major security vulnerability was addressed by implementing a comprehensive admin authentication system using JWT. The trajectory concluded with the development of a bulletproof deployment system designed to automate environment management, frontend builds, and service restarts, aiming to eliminate recurring manual fixes and ensure consistent deployments. This final task currently faces a  command failure due to special characters in a generated JWT secret.

<product_requirements>
The Tax Sale Compass application centralizes Nova Scotia tax sale data, offering an interactive map, PDF scraping, property filtering, and Google Maps integration. Key features include detailed property pages, Google AdSense monetization, and admin management for municipalities and scraping. Recent enhancements expanded to dynamic external links and municipality-specific descriptions. A primary focus was the in-app deployment automation from the admin page, with Check Updates, Deploy Latest, Verify Status, and Health Check functionalities, backed by FastAPI endpoints and shell scripts. The immediate goals were to fully debug this automation on a VPS, rectify 504 Gateway Timeout issues, resolve malformed image URLs, fix No updates available display discrepancies, and, critically, implement a robust admin authentication system to secure the site before public exposure. The most recent overarching goal is to establish a bulletproof deployment system to prevent recurring manual fixes.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was in the process of setting up a new bulletproof deployment system on the VPS. This system aims to automate environment management, frontend rebuilds, and service restarts to prevent recurring deployment issues. The  script was executed on the VPS. However, this script encountered a  during the Initializing environment management step. Specifically, a  command within the  script failed with the error , followed by Environment management initialization failed. This error is diagnosed as being caused by special characters (like ) in the newly generated JWT secret conflicting with 's default delimiter. The  command was also not found, indicating the setup was incomplete. The current task is to fix this  command failure to allow the robust deployment system to be initialized successfully.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Fix the  command in  to correctly handle special characters in the JWT secret during environment initialization.
