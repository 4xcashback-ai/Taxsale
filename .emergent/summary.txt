The trajectory details an extensive development and debugging phase for the Tax Sale Compass application. Initially, the AI engineer addressed a user report about missing PVSC data, leading to the discovery of duplicate backend endpoints for enhanced property details. This involved removing the problematic Playwright-based endpoint, then fixing subsequent 401 authentication errors for admin users by unifying token usage and adjusting  logic. The AI engineer also corrected the admin's subscription status from free to paid across frontend contexts. User feedback prompted fixes for Victoria County properties, which were incorrectly set to active and lacked auction results; these were updated to inactive with a pending auction status. The UI's statistics display was then updated to correctly reflect inactive properties by adjusting API calls. Further, a province-tracking system with authentic Nova Scotia flags was implemented on the landing page and authenticated header. Finally, the AI engineer systematically resolved several console errors, including authentication 401s and token inconsistencies, leaving the property image 404s (due to geocoding issues) as a recognized pending task.

<product_requirements>
The Tax Sale Compass application aims to centralize Nova Scotia tax sale data, offering an interactive map, PDF scraping, property filtering, and detailed property pages. Key features include Google AdSense, an admin interface for municipality and scraper management, and in-app deployment automation. Initial requirements involved resolving s, malformed image URLs, data discrepancies, and robust admin authentication for a bulletproof deployment system. The system handles multiple Parcel Identification Numbers (PIDs) for map display, tracks auction statuses (winning bids), and features a smart scheduler. A comprehensive landing page was requested with user accounts (free/paid tiers), displaying limited properties/thumbnails, and requiring account creation for detailed views. User tiers (free/paid/admin) dictate access. Recent additions include a Cumberland County scraper and a generic scraper scheduling system. Subsequent requests in the trajectory involved restoring detailed PVSC assessment information, setting admin as a subscribing member, accurately displaying Victoria County property statuses (from active to pending inactive), implementing province tracking with flags on the landing page and header, and adding comprehensive scraper scheduling (daily/weekly/monthly).

- ****:
    - **Importance**: The core FastAPI application, handling all API endpoints and database interactions.
    - **Changes Made**:
        - Removed duplicate  endpoint (Playwright-based).
        - Fixed  and  to properly handle admin users by providing a  object instead of looking them up in the user database.
        - Fixed an exception handling bug where 401/403 errors were converted to 500.
        - Modified the  endpoint to accept  to return all properties, including inactive ones.
        - Updated Victoria County properties'  to inactive and  to pending.

- ****:
    - **Importance**: Main React component managing global state, routing, and UI layout.
    - **Changes Made**:
        - Updated statistics header to accurately reflect 3 Inactive properties by ensuring  uses  when querying the backend.
        - Implemented UI for scraper scheduling (daily, weekly, monthly options) within the municipality management section.
        - Updated , , and  to include and reset new scheduling fields, and added  for real-time UI refresh.
        - Unified  to  for deployment functions for consistency.
        - Updated the authenticated app's header to display Provinces Covered with a dynamic count and a real Nova Scotia flag image, consistent with the landing page.

- ****:
    - **Importance**: Displays detailed property information.
    - **Changes Made**: Added  header to the fetch request for the enhanced property details endpoint, as it now requires authentication.

- ****:
    - **Importance**: Manages global user authentication state.
    - **Changes Made**: Modified the hardcoded admin user object to have  in  and  functions to treat admin as a paid subscriber.

- ****:
    - **Importance**: The entry point for unauthenticated users, displaying high-level statistics.
    - **Changes Made**:
        - Removed Properties Tracked section.
        - Moved Provinces Covered to the primary statistics position.
        - Added dynamic province count (currently 1) and a real Nova Scotia flag image ().
        - Updated  to include  to ensure inactive properties are included in sample data for statistics.

<pending_tasks>
- Fix geocoding for 3 Cumberland County properties (07486596, 01578626, 10802059) to enable thumbnail generation and resolve 404 errors for property images.
- Implement email alerts for new tax sales.
- Implement property history tracking and analytics.
- Finalize Kubernetes ingress/proxy routing for boundary generation endpoints.
- Ensure development environment stability and functionality (minor Google Maps async loading warning).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was focused on resolving multiple JavaScript console errors observed in the preview environment. This included addressing  errors from  and  endpoints by:
1.  **Updating **: Modified the  function (and re-verified ) to properly handle admin users, ensuring the admin's  is correctly set to paid and that JWT tokens are processed for admin access.
2.  **Updating **: Standardized the token key used in  from  to  across all deployment-related frontend functions to resolve authentication inconsistencies.
The Google Maps API loading warning was noted as a minor performance issue but not a critical error. The  errors for Cumberland County property images were identified as a known, pending geocoding issue, not a direct application error. All major authentication-related console errors were successfully resolved, resulting in a cleaner, more robust application.

<optional_next_step>
The next step is to address the pending task of fixing geocoding for the 3 Cumberland County properties.
