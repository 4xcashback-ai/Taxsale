The AI engineer's work on Tax Sale Compass involved extensive feature development, bug fixes, and system stabilization following an accidental code rewrite. Initial efforts focused on restoring critical UI components like interactive maps and the admin panel, resolving environment variable conflicts, and ensuring proper API routing. A major deliverable was a robust VPS deployment system, complete with backend endpoints, shell scripts, and an intuitive frontend UI. Authentication was a recurring challenge, requiring meticulous debugging of login flows and  issues. Significant work went into data consistency and media generation, including fixing Halifax boundary data extraction, thumbnail generation, and preserving these images during scraper updates. New features such as a Cumberland County scraper and a comprehensive scheduling system were implemented. Frontend issues like a statistics header bug and AdSense duplication were also resolved. The current focus is on restoring detailed PVSC assessment information on property detail pages by creating a new backend API endpoint.

<product_requirements>
The Tax Sale Compass application aims to be a central hub for Nova Scotia tax sale data, providing an interactive map, PDF scraping, property filtering, Google Maps integration, and detailed property pages. Initial requirements included Google AdSense and an admin interface for municipality management and scraping, with a key feature being in-app deployment automation. Subsequent tasks involved debugging  errors, malformed image URLs, No updates available discrepancies, and implementing robust admin authentication for a bulletproof deployment system. The system required enhanced property data handling for multiple Parcel Identification Numbers (PIDs) for combined display on maps. Further enhancements included a sophisticated auction status system, tracking winning bids, and a smart scheduler. A comprehensive landing page was requested, featuring user accounts (free/paid tiers), displaying limited properties/thumbnails, and requiring account creation for detailed views. User tiers (free/paid/admin) dictate access to property details. Recent additions include a Cumberland County scraper and a generic scraper scheduling system.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on restoring the Detailed Assessment Information (PVSC data) on the property details page. This information was missing because the frontend component  was attempting to fetch it from a non-existent backend endpoint: . The AI engineer had just identified this missing endpoint and confirmed existing backend integration with  (PVSC). The current task involved creating this new  endpoint in  to fetch and provide the detailed PVSC assessment data to the frontend. The last action was successfully adding the initial logic for this new endpoint.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Restart the backend service to make the newly created  endpoint available.
