The trajectory outlines the AI engineer's intensive journey in stabilizing and enhancing the Tax Sale Compass application. The initial phase involved rectifying an accidental  rewrite that destroyed core functionalities, followed by painstaking restoration of interactive maps, image displays, and the admin panel, alongside persistent  and  prefix debugging. Critical pivots included clarifying user intent (keeping authentication but matching the *authenticated* experience to the live site) and resolving complex issues such as Google Maps Static API limitations with coordinate precision for boundary thumbnails. Iterative debugging, often using sub-agents like  and automated testing, was essential to identify root causes like filter mismatches, database-file discrepancies, and routing conflicts. The process highlights a blend of UI/UX refinement, backend logic fixes, and persistent environment variable issues, culminating in a largely functional, visually refined, and securely authenticated application, with key features like dynamic property boundaries and consistent statistics now working.

<product_requirements>
The Tax Sale Compass application aims to be a central hub for Nova Scotia tax sale data, offering an interactive map, PDF scraping, property filtering, Google Maps integration, and detailed property pages. Initial requirements included Google AdSense and an admin interface for municipality management and scraping, with a key feature being in-app deployment automation. Subsequent tasks involved debugging  errors, malformed image URLs, No updates available discrepancies, and implementing robust admin authentication for a bulletproof deployment system. The system required enhanced property data handling for multiple Parcel Identification Numbers (PIDs) for combined display on maps. Further enhancements included a sophisticated auction status system (, /, , , , ), tracking winning bids, and a smart scheduler. A comprehensive landing page was requested, featuring user accounts (free/paid tiers), displaying limited properties/thumbnails, and requiring account creation for detailed views. Free users should view all listings and inactive property details, paid users access all properties and details, and admin users access everything.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was addressing a bug where the statistics header, while visible on the landing page, would disappear or show incorrect data when a user logged into the authenticated application. This was identified as a filter default behavior issue within the  component, where the authenticated app's property list (and thus its statistics calculation) defaulted to filtering , but all current properties in the database were .

The AI engineer's actions focused on fixing this by modifying  to change the  state's initial value from  to . This ensures that upon login, the authenticated app correctly fetches and displays statistics for all available properties, regardless of their 'active' or 'inactive' status, thus making the statistics bar consistent across both the landing page and the authenticated user's view. This was the final step in a series of fixes related to the statistics header's consistent display and data accuracy.
