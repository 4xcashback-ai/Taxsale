The previous AI engineer successfully initiated a Nova Scotia Tax Sale Aggregator application using a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB. The project began with defining core features: scraping tax sale data from all Nova Scotia municipalities, displaying it in a searchable and map-based interface, with weekly updates.

The development progressed through several iterations. Initially, the AI engineer set up the basic application structure, implemented a foundational UI, and created endpoints for municipality management and data display. Key enhancements included the integration of interactive maps using React-Leaflet and adding external links to PVSC (Property Valuation Services Corporation) for assessment details, Viewpoint.ca for property locations (via PID), and municipal websites for tax sale pages.

A significant portion of the work involved iterative bug fixing related to data scraping and integrity. The scraper for Halifax Regional Municipality proved particularly challenging due to complex PDF parsing, missing Assessment Numbers (AANs), incorrect data mappings, and duplicate detection issues. The engineer repeatedly refined the scraper, cleared and re-scraped the database, and updated the UI to display accurate property, owner, and legal information (including redeemable status and HST requirements).

The final state of the trajectory shows the engineer attempting to fully implement a robust PDF parsing mechanism for the Halifax tax sale data, recognizing previous attempts at data extraction were flawed. The current challenge is to correctly read and interpret the structured information from the provided PDF, rather than relying on manual data reconstruction or flawed parsing.

<product_requirements>
The user requested a web application to scrape Nova Scotia municipality websites for tax sale information, store it, and display it in a searchable and map-based format.

**Initial Requirements (MVP):**
*   **Data to Scrape:** Tax sales information.
*   **Municipalities:** All Nova Scotia municipalities.
*   **Search/Display Features:** Search by municipality name, map-based interface.
*   **Scraping Frequency:** Weekly updates.

**Subsequent Enhancements:**
*   **Real Web Scraping:** Implement actual scraping of municipality websites (starting with Halifax).
*   **Interactive Map Integration:** Display properties geographically using an interactive map.
*   **Weekly Scheduling System:** Automate scraping on a weekly basis.
*   **External Links:**
    *   Assessment Numbers (AAN) link to PVSC (Property Valuation Services Corporation).
    *   PID (Parcel Identification Number) link to Viewpoint.ca for property locations.
    *   Municipality names link back to their respective tax sale pages.
*   **Redeemable Information:** Include details on property redeemability and HST status.
*   **Data Accuracy:** Ensure all scraped data (AAN, owner, address, PID, opening bid, HST, redeemable) is correct and matches source documents, and that all properties are displayed.
*   **Database Management:** Clear old sample data and use only actual scraped data.
*   **PDF Parsing:** Develop a robust scraper to automatically find, download, and correctly parse PDF documents containing tax sale data from municipal websites.

<code_architecture>



-   **/app/backend/server.py**:
    -   **Summary**: This is the core FastAPI application file, handling API routes, database interactions (MongoDB), web scraping logic, and scheduling. It defines data models, CRUD operations for municipalities and tax sale properties, and the scraping functions.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   Initial setup of FastAPI app, CORS, MongoDB connection.
        -   Defined Pydantic models for  and  (including fields like , , , , , , , ).
        -   Implemented endpoints for , , , , , .
        -   The  function was repeatedly modified to correctly find and parse the Halifax tax sale data, initially using direct links and later attempting PDF parsing.
        -    was integrated for weekly scraping.
        -   Duplicate detection logic in  was refined to handle properties with and without assessment numbers using a combination of AAN, owner name, and address.

-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**:
    -   **Summary**: This is the main React component, rendering the application's UI, including the header, tabs (Search, Map View, Admin), search bar, property cards, and the interactive map. It fetches data from the FastAPI backend and displays it.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   Initial UI structure with Tailwind CSS for layout and styling.
        -   Implemented search functionality and municipality filtering.
        -   Integrated Shadcn UI components (tabs, input, button, select, card).
        -   Integrated  for the interactive map view, displaying property markers with popups.
        -   Added logic to display property details, including dynamically generated external links for AAN (PVSC), PID (Viewpoint.ca), and Municipality (official tax sale page).
        -   Introduced an amber warning box to display  and  information prominently.
        -   Updated Admin panel UI to show system statistics and scraper status.

-   **/app/frontend/package.json**:
    -   **Summary**: Manages Node.js dependencies for the React frontend.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   Added  and  for map integration.

-   **/app/backend/requirements.txt**:
    -   **Summary**: Manages Python dependencies for the FastAPI backend.

        -   Added  and  for MongoDB interaction.
        -    for environment variable management.

-   **/app/backend/.env & /app/frontend/.env**:
    -   **Summary**: Configuration files for environment variables.
    -   **Changes Made**: These files were confirmed to exist and contain  and  respectively, but their *values* were explicitly not modified. The backend uses  and frontend uses .

<current_work>
The AI engineer was most recently working on correctly parsing the Halifax tax sale PDF document. The user provided a PDF () which the engineer had been attempting to parse. Previous attempts at parsing led to incorrect data, missing Assessment Numbers (AANs), and placeholder property descriptions.

The engineer acknowledged that the scraper's approach to parsing the PDF was flawed. The task immediately before this summary request was to completely rebuild the Halifax scraper to:
1.  Automatically find the PDF link on the Halifax tax sale page.
2.  Programmatically download the PDF.
3.  Correctly parse the PDF's table structure to extract all property data (Owner Names, Property Descriptions, PIDs, Opening Bids, HST status, Redeemable status).

The engineer had just started implementing the PDF parsing logic in  and had updated sections related to property data handling, aiming to remove all hardcoded and placeholder data in favor of data extracted directly from the PDF. The last action was to confirm the previous edit and prepare to add the missing PDF parsing dependencies and complete the solution.
