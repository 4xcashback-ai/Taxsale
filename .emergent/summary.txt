The AI engineer's work involved extensive debugging and feature implementation for the Tax Sale Compass application. Initial efforts centered on fixing a critical  command failure in the bulletproof deployment system, resolving conflicting usage: git [-v | --version] [-h | --help] [-C <path>] [-c <name>=<value>]

A major database issue (missing data) was resolved by correcting a database name mismatch ( to ). The absence of property images and URI malformed errors led to fixing Google Maps API key configuration and deploying the previously missing boundary image generation system. The trajectory concludes with the implementation of multi-PID support for property data and the interactive map, where the backend API and frontend display logic are being updated to handle multiple PIDs from a single request, with the current task focused on correctly refactoring backend multi-PID logic.

<product_requirements>
The Tax Sale Compass application centralizes Nova Scotia tax sale data, providing an interactive map, PDF scraping, property filtering, and Google Maps integration. It includes detailed property pages, Google AdSense for monetization, and an admin interface for managing municipalities and scraping tasks. Recent enhancements focused on dynamic external links and municipality-specific descriptions. A core feature developed was in-app deployment automation from the admin page, offering Check Updates, Deploy Latest, Verify Status, and Health Check. The AI engineer was explicitly tasked with debugging this automation, fixing  errors, resolving malformed image URLs and No updates available display discrepancies, and implementing robust admin authentication. The overarching goal was to create a bulletproof deployment system. The latest task involves enhancing property data handling to support properties with multiple Parcel Identification Numbers (PIDs), ensuring the backend API and frontend map correctly query, process, and display combined data for such properties.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was working on implementing multi-PID (Parcel Identification Number) support for the Tax Sale Compass application. This involved modifying the backend API endpoint  in  to accept a -separated string of PIDs. The goal is for this endpoint to query each PID individually from the NS Government parcel service, combine their geometries into a single, unified boundary, and return this consolidated data.

The corresponding frontend component, , was updated to correctly format requests for multi-PID properties and to visually represent the combined boundary data on the interactive map. It also includes visual indicators () and updates the legal description display.

However, after these changes, a persistent  error was observed when testing the multi-PID endpoint from the frontend in the development environment. Diagnosis revealed two primary issues:
1.  The  in  had reverted to  instead of , causing frontend requests to go to the wrong backend instance. This was manually corrected.
2.  Even after correcting the frontend URL, the backend API still returned  for multi-PID requests, although single-PID requests worked. This indicates a logical error in the newly implemented multi-PID backend code. The AI engineer deduced that the existing logic for querying a single PID was not correctly encapsulated into the  helper function, leading to incorrect parsing or processing of multi-PID requests within the main endpoint.

The immediate next step is to correctly refactor the  to ensure the  function properly contains the single-PID logic and the main multi-PID endpoint accurately uses this helper or its own logic to combine results.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Correctly refactor the  function in  to properly handle single PIDs and ensure the main endpoint dispatches correctly for multi-PID requests.
