The AI engineer successfully enhanced the Tax Sale Compass application through multiple iterations of feature development and critical bug fixes. Initial work focused on fixing PID extraction, property type classification (especially for apartment properties), and interactive map functionalities, including boundary data persistence. A significant phase involved implementing Google Maps address-based geocoding for properties lacking PID-based boundaries. This required debugging environment variables (), fixing  errors in API responses, and running batch updates. Subsequently, the focus shifted to a major UI/UX redesign of the property details page and a robust integration with the Property Valuation Services Corporation (PVSC) data. This involved creating new database tables, developing HTML scraping logic (as the PVSC API returned HTML, not JSON), handling complex data parsing (e.g., decimal land sizes), and adding new display fields. The final tasks revolved around refining the layout of the property details page based on user feedback, ensuring map boundaries displayed correctly, and fixing various deployment and data population issues on a VPS environment, confirming a working end-to-end PVSC data display.

The Tax Sale Compass application provides centralized Canada-wide tax sale data with an interactive map, PDF scraping, and property filtering, supported by a subscription model. It uses a PHP frontend, Python FastAPI backend, and MySQL database.

The core problem addressed was the inability of the Rescan functionality to find and update data reliably. Key enhancements and bug fixes implemented or requested include:
1.  **Embedded PID Extraction**: Extract PIDs from civic address strings.
2.  **Frontend Connectivity**: Ensure PHP frontend connects to Python backend.
3.  **Property Type Classification**: Accurately classify properties as apartment.
4.  **Enhanced Admin Edit Functionality**: Pre-populate edit modals for properties, including coordinate updates.
5.  **Interactive Property Map**: Display a satellite map with property boundaries, controls, and smart zooming.
6.  **Boundary Data Persistence**: Fix bugs preventing boundary data from saving.
7.  **Retroactive Boundary Generation**: Populate missing boundary data for existing properties.
8.  **Address-based Geocoding**: Implement geocoding for properties (like apartments) without PID-based boundaries to ensure map display.
9.  **Property Details Page Redesign**: Modernize styling of , displaying property info, map, and PVSC data coherently.
10. **PVSC Data Integration**: Scrape comprehensive data from PVSC (Property Valuation Services Corporation) using Assessment Numbers, store it in the database, and display it in a detailed table on the property page. This includes specific fields like Finished Basement and Garage.
11. **Layout Refinement**: Arrange map, property info, minimum bid, and PVSC data in a specific side-by-side layout on the property details page.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing the user's explicit feedback regarding the layout of the property details page (). The user requested to have the interactive map at the top of the left column, with both the Property Information and PVSC Data sections stacked directly below it, also within the left column. The right column should retain the Minimum Bid card and Property Actions.

The AI engineer successfully implemented this layout adjustment by modifying  to arrange these sections accordingly. This involved refactoring the HTML/PHP structure to create a two-column layout ( for the left and  for the right), and then placing the map, followed by the property information, and then the comprehensive PVSC data table, all within the left column. The minimum bid card and property actions were kept in the right column as requested.

The PVSC data integration now includes all the requested fields like Garage and Basement (with colored badges), Construction Quality, Building Style, and handles complex numeric parsing (e.g., correct sum for Land Size like 1.94 Acres). The interactive map is also functioning, displaying boundaries correctly (after re-running the boundary generation script).

The current state is that the backend API is successfully geocoding addresses for properties without PID boundaries, scraping and storing comprehensive PVSC data (after fixing the HTML parsing and database updates), and the frontend  is designed to display all this information in the specified layout.

<optional_next_step>
The next step is to test the property page on the VPS to verify the new layout and data display.
