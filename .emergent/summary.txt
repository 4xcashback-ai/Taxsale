<analysis>
The AI engineer's work on the Tax Sale Compass application focused primarily on resolving critical deployment and environment-specific bugs after an initial successful build by a previous AI. Key initial tasks included validating property boundary image serving via API endpoints, optimizing deployment through Docker and Kubernetes, and resolving database performance issues via indexing. Log clarity was improved by downgrading 404 image errors to  level.

Significant effort was dedicated to two persistent issues: an erroneous updates available notification in the admin panel and inconsistent property boundary overlays/interactive maps on the VPS. The updates available bug was traced to an inverse logic in  and , which was successfully fixed. The boundary overlay issue led to fixes in  for absolute paths and the creation of  for database mismatches.

The most challenging area was the intermittent Google Maps loading on the VPS. After multiple attempts to implement robust JavaScript-based loading (), a temporary pivot to a Python-generated static map solution was explored but rejected by the user. The AI then reverted to the original interactive map approach, leading to a decision for a full VPS rebuild due to persistent environment inconsistencies. The rebuild process encountered various system-level errors, including Docker package conflicts, network issues, missing Python/Node.js dependencies (venv, pip, yarn, pm2), and persistent incorrect PM2 configuration paths, which is the current focus.

<product_requirements>
The Tax Sale Compass application aims to centralize Nova Scotia tax sale data, providing users with an interactive map, PDF scraping capabilities, and robust property filtering. Core features include Google AdSense integration, an admin interface for managing municipalities and scrapers with in-app deployment automation, support for multiple PIDs, auction result tracking, and a smart scheduler. It offers free and paid user tiers, with detailed property access for paid subscribers. Recent development focused on restoring PVSC assessment information, ensuring accurate property status display (e.g., Victoria County), province tracking, and improving scraper scheduling reliability. A Favorites List feature for paid users was a recent beta addition. Current development cycles have concentrated on critical deployment optimization, enhancing database performance, ensuring clean error logging, and resolving UI discrepancies such as missing property boundary overlays on thumbnails and an incorrect updates available notification in the admin panel. The user explicitly prefers the interactive Google Maps and original boundary overlay thumbnails, as they work reliably in the development environment.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was engaged in resolving critical deployment issues on a freshly rebuilt Ubuntu 22.04 LTS VPS, after the user reverted from a Python-based map solution back to the original interactive Google Maps approach due to its reliability in the development environment.

The current challenge is a persistent PM2 configuration error, specifically: . This error indicates that PM2 is attempting to start the backend application from an incorrect, legacy directory path () instead of the correct project root ().

This PM2 path issue follows a series of successful system-level fixes, including:
1.  **Node.js Upgrade**: Successfully upgraded Node.js to  (from ), resolving  and yarn install v1.22.22
