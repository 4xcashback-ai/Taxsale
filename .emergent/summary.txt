The AI engineer successfully enhanced the Tax Sale Compass application through multiple feature additions and significant refactoring. Initially, the focus was on implementing user-requested UI/UX improvements for the property details page, including PVSC data display, financial calculations, and a dynamic auction countdown. This involved extensive PHP frontend modifications and debugging environment setup issues like missing PHP and MySQL. Subsequently, Google AdSense integration was added across the search, property, and landing pages, along with an  file. A major feature, Favorites for paying users, was then implemented. This led to a critical architectural shift: migrating the database from MySQL to MongoDB. This migration, particularly on the user's VPS, became the central and most challenging task, involving installing MongoDB, updating all PHP files to use MongoDB drivers, and debugging persistent  class not found and configuration issues ( constant errors) on the VPS, despite successful local development environment tests. The latest issue revolves around PHP's inability to connect to MongoDB on the VPS, likely due to Composer autoloader problems.

The Tax Sale Compass application aims to centralize Canada-wide tax sale data with an interactive map, PDF scraping, and property filtering, supported by a subscription model. The core problem involved unreliable Rescan functionality. User requests and implemented enhancements include:
1.  **Property Details Page Redesign**: Modernize  to display property info, map, and PVSC data coherently. This involved a two-column layout, moving the interactive map to the top-left, with property information and PVSC data stacked below.
2.  **PVSC Data Integration**: Scrape comprehensive data from Property Valuation Services Corporation, store it, and display it in a detailed, two-column table on the property page, including fields like Finished Basement and Garage.
3.  **Financial Insights**: On the property details page, replace Total Taxes Due with Assessed Value (from PVSC) and add Potential Profit (Assessed Value - Min Bid) with color-coding.
4.  **Auction Countdown**: Implement a dynamic X days Y hours countdown to the auction date on the property details page.
5.  **Google AdSense Integration**: Display ads on the search page (every second row of properties), property details page (right column, between bid and actions), and landing page (between stats and features). Creation of an  file.
6.  **Landing Page Property Showcase**: Display 6 random properties with smart access control: active properties require login, while inactive (sold/withdrawn) properties can be viewed directly.
7.  **Favorites Feature**: Allow paying users to add up to 50 properties to a favorites list, with the property details page showing how many users have favorited it.

Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively debugging critical MongoDB connection issues on the user's VPS. All PHP frontend files (, , , , , , ) have been extensively modified to switch from MySQL to MongoDB. This involved using the  class, MongoDB-specific queries (e.g., aggregation for random properties), and implementing a Composer autoloader (). Helper functions like  were created to properly convert BSON documents. The main VPS deployment script ([2025-09-10 01:28:37] === Starting Tax Sale Compass Deployment ===

The current challenge is that, despite MongoDB being successfully installed and running on the VPS, and the PHP MongoDB extension being loaded, the PHP application cannot establish a connection to MongoDB. The user is still encountering a  when running PHP scripts and a  on the website. This points to a persistent issue where the Composer autoloader is either not correctly configured or not being properly invoked within the PHP-FPM environment on the VPS, preventing the application from finding the necessary MongoDB PHP library classes. The  script reports MongoDB connection test failed from its internal PHP test and the website remains inaccessible.
