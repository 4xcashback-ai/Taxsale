The trajectory describes the continuation of development for the Tax Sale Compass application by an expert AI engineer. Initially, the focus was on completing a pending task: integrating automatic boundary thumbnail generation into the scraping process and updating an admin endpoint to target active properties only. The AI successfully implemented the backend logic in  for this, updating log messages and API responses.

Following this, a series of critical bugs were reported by the user from the VPS environment. First, Failed to get deployment status led to debugging the backend's deployment status endpoint () and the  script, revealing an authentication mismatch and a script path issue on the VPS. These were resolved by providing manual deployment instructions and a script fix. Next, missing quick action buttons for image creation in the frontend were identified and re-implemented in . This led to a git merge conflict on the VPS during deployment, which was being addressed. The most recent critical bug involves properties being found via search but inaccessible via their direct URL on the VPS, which the AI has diagnosed as a missing basic property detail endpoint in the backend.

<product_requirements>
The Tax Sale Compass application is designed to centralize Nova Scotia tax sale data, providing an interactive map, PDF scraping, and advanced property filtering. Core features include Google AdSense, an admin interface with in-app deployment, support for multiple PIDs, auction result tracking, and a smart scheduler. It offers free and paid tiers, with paid subscribers gaining detailed property access and a Favorites List beta. Recent development aimed at restoring PVSC assessment info, accurate property status, province tracking, and improving scraper reliability. Significant efforts addressed deployment optimization, database performance, clean error logging, and UI issues like missing property boundary overlays and incorrect updates available notifications. The user explicitly favors interactive Google Maps and original boundary overlay thumbnails, noting their reliability in the development environment.

<pending_tasks>
-   Implement email alerts for new tax sales.
-   Implement property history tracking and analytics.
-   Finalize Kubernetes ingress/proxy routing for boundary generation endpoints (if needed for the new API).
-   Address the Unknown command: "update-browserslist-db"

To see a list of supported npm commands, run:
  npm help warning during frontend build (if it appears).
-   Resolve Google Maps async loading warning (implicitly covered by map fixes).
-   Add the missing basic property details endpoint in the backend.
-   Resolve git merge conflicts on VPS to deploy latest frontend changes.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was focused on resolving a critical bug where a specific property () could be found through the  search endpoint but was inaccessible via its direct property URL (), which returned a  error.

Through direct API testing ( commands) and backend log analysis, the AI determined that the property *does* exist in the database and is returned by the general search endpoint. However, direct access to  consistently returns . An  endpoint exists, which *does* find the property, but it incorrectly requires authentication for basic property details access and then returns .

The AI has precisely diagnosed the problem: the **basic property details endpoint is missing from the backend**. The immediate task is to implement this missing endpoint to allow unauthenticated access to property details when found. This work is part of a series of bug fixes following a manual deployment process on the VPS, which itself followed fixing authentication and a deployment script issue.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
The next step is to add the missing basic property details endpoint in  that can retrieve property information by assessment number without requiring authentication.
