The AI engineer successfully navigated a complex debugging and feature development trajectory for the Tax Sale Compass application. Initial work focused on fixing a critical bug where PIDs embedded in civic addresses were not extracted; this involved modifying  and . Database schema issues related to  ENUM truncation were also resolved. A significant enhancement was implemented to correctly classify apartment properties (like ), updating scraping logic, database schema, and frontend displays. The interactive map on property details pages was improved with satellite view and boundary visualization. A crucial bug in boundary data persistence, where  was used instead of  for database writes, was identified and fixed in , resolving issues with boundaries not displaying. Finally, a batch process was deployed to retroactively populate missing boundary data for most properties. The current focus is on the remaining properties (specifically apartments) that lack PID-based boundary data, requiring an address-based geocoding solution for map display.

The Tax Sale Compass application centralizes Canada-wide tax sale data, featuring an interactive map, PDF scraping, and property filtering, supported by a subscription model. It uses a PHP frontend, Python FastAPI backend, and MySQL database.
The primary problem addressed in this trajectory was a persistent failure of the Rescan functionality for properties, particularly its inability to correctly find and update data. Key feature requests and bug fixes included:
1.  **Embedded PID Extraction**: Extracting and storing PIDs embedded within civic address strings.
2.  **Frontend Connectivity**: Resolving issues where the PHP frontend could not connect to the Python backend API.
3.  **Property Type Classification**: Accurately classifying properties as apartment (distinct from mixed or land).
4.  **Enhanced Admin Edit Functionality**: Implementing comprehensive, pre-populated edit modals in both Missing PIDs and Thumbnail Debug Info sections, allowing edits to PID, Address, Owner, and Property Type (AAN read-only), including coordinate updates.
5.  **Interactive Property Map**: Displaying an interactive satellite map with property boundaries on the details page, featuring map controls and smart zooming.
6.  **Boundary Data Persistence**: Fixing a critical bug where fetched property boundary data was not being saved to the database.
7.  **Retroactive Boundary Generation**: Populating missing boundary data for existing properties.
8.  **Dynamic Scraper Configuration**: Ensuring the scraper can dynamically find new tax sale documents.

<pending_tasks>
-   Implement address-based geocoding for apartment/building-only properties (like 07737947) to assign coordinates for map display, as they lack PID-based parcel boundaries.
-   Ensure all scrapers (Victoria, Cumberland) are fully functional and accurately extracting data.
-   Fine-tune Nginx and PHP-FPM for optimal performance.
-   Set up monitoring and logging for production use.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer successfully implemented and executed a batch script () on the VPS. This script was designed to retroactively generate and save boundary data for properties that had previously failed to store this information due to a bug in the API's database update mechanism (specifically, the  endpoint in  was incorrectly using  instead of  to save the  JSON and coordinates).

The batch script processed 55 properties. It successfully generated and saved boundary data for 54 properties, which are now correctly displayed on the interactive maps. The one property that failed, , was correctly identified as an apartment (Unit 209). As apartments do not have individual parcel (PID-based) boundaries in the government system, the API returned No boundary data found for 07737947.

The current task is to address this specific scenario: properties (like apartments or building-only types) that do not have PID-based parcel boundaries but still need to be represented on the interactive map. The proposed solution involves implementing an address-based geocoding approach to assign coordinates for such properties, ensuring they are displayed on the map even without detailed boundary geometry. The AI engineer is preparing to handle these apartment/building-only properties distinctly.
