The AI engineer successfully guided the application from its initial state through several critical bug fixes and new feature implementations. Initially, the focus was on resolving backend issues like duplicate endpoints, authentication errors for admin users, and incorrect property statuses. This involved unifying token usage, adjusting  logic, and updating property data. A significant feature addition was the province-tracking system on the landing page and header. Subsequently, the AI addressed persistent 404 errors for Cumberland County property images, diagnosing missing geocoordinates and incorrect boundary image filenames, which was resolved by programmatically updating property data. A bug preventing municipality scheduling for all regions was fixed by updating the backend's  model. The major new feature, a Favorites List for paid users with thumbnails, was fully implemented across backend API and frontend UI. Deployment to a VPS environment followed, where the AI debugged  errors, PM2 configuration issues, and an empty database backup, leading to a successful manual deployment. The final challenge involved fixing a hardcoded scraping logic that incorrectly routed Cumberland County to a generic scraper, which was resolved by updating the specific  endpoint to use dynamic  routing.

The Tax Sale Compass application centralizes Nova Scotia tax sale data, featuring an interactive map, PDF scraping, and property filtering. Core functionality includes Google AdSense, an admin interface for municipality and scraper management, and in-app deployment automation. Initial problems involved resolving s, malformed image URLs, data discrepancies, and robust admin authentication. The system supports multiple PIDs, tracks auction results, and includes a smart scheduler. A landing page provides free/paid user tiers, limited property views, and requires accounts for detailed access. Recently, the app needed to restore detailed PVSC assessment info, establish admin as a paid subscriber, accurately display Victoria County property statuses, implement province tracking with flags, and add comprehensive scraper scheduling (daily/weekly/monthly). A Favorites List for paid users, limited to 50 properties with thumbnails, public favorite counts, and add/remove functionality, was a key beta feature. Further, Cumberland County properties needed to display public auction instead of public tender, and its specific scraper had to function correctly in production.

<pending_tasks>
- Implement email alerts for new tax sales.
- Implement property history tracking and analytics.
- Finalize Kubernetes ingress/proxy routing for boundary generation endpoints.
- Ensure development environment stability and functionality (minor Google Maps async loading warning).
- Implement a specific scraper for Cumberland County's website format (currently falls back to generic, though the routing is now fixed).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was addressing a critical bug related to the Cumberland County scraper. Despite previous efforts to implement the specific scraper and configure its routing, the system was still defaulting to a generic scraper for Cumberland County, as indicated by logs stating Generic scraping for Cumberland County - specific scraper not yet implemented.

The root cause was identified in the  file within the  endpoint. This specific endpoint, used by the admin panel to trigger individual municipality scrapes, contained hardcoded logic: . This meant only Halifax was being routed to its specific scraper, while all other municipalities, including Cumberland County, were incorrectly sent to the generic scraper.

The AI engineer's action was to modify this hardcoded  block. The updated logic now dynamically checks the  field of the  object and dispatches the request to the correct specific scraper function (e.g., ) or falls back to the generic one only if no specific scraper type is matched.

The trajectory ends with the AI engineer instructing to restart the backend to apply these code changes and then re-test the Cumberland County scraper, expecting to see Starting Cumberland County tax sale scraping in the logs.

Restart the backend to apply the fixed scraper routing logic and verify in logs that Cumberland County uses its specific scraper.
