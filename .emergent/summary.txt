The AI engineer's trajectory chronicles a rigorous debugging and implementation process, starting with a comprehensive VPS deployment guide and evolving into integrating and stabilizing an in-app deployment automation system. The core challenge was transforming the theoretical deployment plan into a functional, resilient system on a live VPS. This involved persistent debugging of PM2 configurations, fixing critical pathing discrepancies between local and VPS environments, adding missing API endpoints, and resolving complex service interaction issues like Nginx proxying to IPv6. A significant effort was made to fix frontend UI issues where buttons weren't triggering actions, ultimately traced to an outdated production build. Later, persistent  errors led to deep dives into shell script execution contexts,  configurations, and finally, a critical decision to refactor backend subprocess calls to direct HTTP requests, circumventing environment-specific  hangs within FastAPI. The process was iterative, marked by systematic diagnosis of logs and direct system tests.

The Tax Sale Compass application provides a centralized platform for Nova Scotia tax sale data, featuring an interactive map, PDF scraping for various municipalities (including Halifax, Cape Breton, Kentville, and Victoria County), and detailed property pages with PVSC assessment data. Key functionalities include property filtering, Google Maps integration for boundaries, and Google AdSense monetization. Administrators can manage municipalities and scraping schedules. Recent enhancements focused on comprehensive property detail display, interactive maps with boundary polygons, advanced search capabilities, dynamic external links, and municipality-specific descriptions. A major new feature request was the implementation of in-app deployment automation directly from the admin page, offering Check Updates, Deploy Latest, Verify Status, and Health Check functionalities, supported by backend API endpoints and shell scripts. The current development focus is to fully implement and debug this in-app deployment automation on the VPS environment, ensuring all its components function correctly and the UI accurately reflects deployment status.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was deep in resolving a persistent  error occurring when the  endpoint was called from the frontend. This issue stemmed from the FastAPI backend's  call to  consistently timing out after 60 seconds, despite the script running successfully in under a second when executed manually (even as the  user).

Previous debugging steps confirmed:
1.  The  script works perfectly when run directly.
2.  The Python  call itself (tested via a direct Python script outside FastAPI) also executes the  script successfully and immediately.
3.  The  file was correctly configured to allow  to execute , , and  without a password.
4.  Unnecessary  was removed from the main  script.
5.  Frontend environment variables were corrected to point to , and a fresh production build was created, resolving issues with buttons not triggering API calls and calls going to a preview server.

The crucial finding is that the  call only timed out when executed *within the FastAPI web server context*. This indicates an environment-specific interaction or a subtlety in how FastAPI handles . The current work involves **replacing the  call in the  endpoint with direct HTTP  calls** to  and . This completely bypasses the problematic subprocess interaction within the FastAPI application.
