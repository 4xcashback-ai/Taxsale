# Deployment Path Fixes - Hardcoded References Resolved

## Overview
This document summarizes all the hardcoded path issues that were fixed to ensure proper deployment on the VPS server. The main issue was references to old directory names and paths that would cause failures during deployment.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Directory Name Changes
- **Old**: `tax-sale-compass` 
- **New**: `nstaxsales`
- **Reason**: Match the actual VPS directory structure

### 2. Script Directory Path Changes
- **Old**: `/opt/tax-sale-compass/scripts/`
- **New**: `/var/www/nstaxsales/scripts/`
- **Reason**: Scripts should be located within the application directory for easier management

### 3. Application Directory Changes
- **Old**: `/var/www/tax-sale-compass`
- **New**: `/var/www/nstaxsales`
- **Reason**: Match the actual VPS deployment directory

## Files Modified

### Backend API Endpoints (`/app/backend/server.py`)
- Fixed deployment status script path
- Fixed deployment check-updates script path
- Fixed deployment deploy script path
- Fixed system health script path
- Fixed deployment verify script path

**Changes:**
```bash
# OLD PATHS
/opt/tax-sale-compass/scripts/deployment-status.sh
/opt/tax-sale-compass/scripts/deployment.sh
/opt/tax-sale-compass/scripts/system-health.sh

# NEW PATHS
/var/www/nstaxsales/scripts/deployment-status.sh
/var/www/nstaxsales/scripts/deployment.sh
/var/www/nstaxsales/scripts/system-health.sh
```

### Automation Scripts

#### `/app/scripts/deployment.sh`
- Fixed APP_DIR path
- Fixed BACKUP_DIR path
- Fixed rollback restoration path
- Fixed example GitHub URL in usage

**Key Changes:**
```bash
APP_DIR="/var/www/nstaxsales"
BACKUP_DIR="/var/backups/nstaxsales"
```

#### `/app/scripts/system-health.sh`
- Fixed APP_DIR path

**Key Changes:**
```bash
APP_DIR="/var/www/nstaxsales"
```

#### `/app/scripts/setup-automation.sh`
- Fixed SCRIPT_DIR path
- Fixed backup directory path
- Fixed sudoers configuration
- Fixed log rotation configuration
- Fixed deployment status script paths
- Fixed cron job paths
- Fixed test script paths
- Updated command names for consistency

**Key Changes:**
```bash
SCRIPT_DIR="/var/www/nstaxsales/scripts"
# Updated sudoers, cron jobs, and test paths accordingly
```

### Documentation Updates

#### `/app/VPS_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`
- Updated all directory paths from `tax-sale-compass` to `nstaxsales`
- Fixed GitHub repository example URLs
- Updated PM2 ecosystem configuration paths
- Fixed Nginx static files path
- Updated ownership commands

**Key Changes:**
```bash
# Directory navigation
cd /var/www/nstaxsales/backend
cd /var/www/nstaxsales/frontend
cd /var/www/nstaxsales

# PM2 configuration
cwd: '/var/www/nstaxsales/backend'
cwd: '/var/www/nstaxsales/frontend'

# Nginx static files
alias /var/www/nstaxsales/backend/static/;

# Ownership
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /var/www/nstaxsales
```

## Impact on Deployment

### Before Fixes
- Deployment would fail due to missing script paths
- Backend API endpoints would return errors for deployment management
- Automation scripts would look for files in wrong directories
- VPS setup would create incorrect directory structures

### After Fixes
- ✅ All script paths point to correct locations within the application directory
- ✅ Backend API endpoints can successfully call automation scripts
- ✅ Deployment automation works correctly on VPS
- ✅ All documentation matches actual deployment structure
- ✅ No hardcoded paths that would fail during server migration

## Verification Steps

To verify these fixes work correctly on the VPS:

1. **Check script paths exist:**
   ```bash
   ls -la /var/www/nstaxsales/scripts/
   ```

2. **Test backend API endpoints:**
   ```bash
   curl https://yourdomain.com/api/deployment/status
   curl https://yourdomain.com/api/deployment/health
   ```

3. **Verify automation scripts can be executed:**
   ```bash
   sudo /var/www/nstaxsales/scripts/deployment.sh verify
   sudo /var/www/nstaxsales/scripts/system-health.sh check
   ```

4. **Check frontend deployment management UI:**
   - Navigate to Admin tab
   - Click deployment management buttons
   - Verify proper status updates and API responses

## Conclusion

All hardcoded path references have been systematically identified and fixed. The deployment system now uses consistent, correct paths that match the actual VPS directory structure. This ensures:

- ✅ Successful VPS deployment without path-related errors
- ✅ Working deployment automation from the admin panel
- ✅ Proper script execution with correct permissions
- ✅ Consistent documentation that matches actual deployment
- ✅ No environment-specific hardcoding that could cause future issues

The deployment management system is now ready for production use on the VPS server.
