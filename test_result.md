# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

Comprehensive testing of 62 Halifax properties reveals multiple critical issues exactly as reported by user: 1) OWNER NAME TRUNCATION: Assessment #00079006 shows 'OWEN ST. CLAI' (13 chars) instead of full 'OWEN ST. CLAIR ANDERSON A2' - confirming user's truncation report. 2) SYSTEMATIC TRUNCATION: 17 properties (27.4%) show suspicious truncation patterns with abnormally short owner names. 3) GENERIC REDEEMABLE STATUS: ALL properties show placeholder 'Contact HRM for redemption status' instead of actual PDF values (Yes/No/Subject to redemption). 4) GENERIC HST STATUS: ALL properties show placeholder 'Contact HRM for HST details' instead of actual PDF values. Raw data analysis confirms truncation occurs during PDF parsing - both processed and raw data contain same truncated values. The PDF parsing logic is cutting off owner names and not extracting actual redeemable/HST status from PDF. User's concerns are 100% validated."

Comprehensive testing of 62 Halifax properties shows 25.4% (15 properties) have owner names embedded in addresses, indicating widespread systematic bug.
