# Tax Sale Compass - Test Results

## User Problem Statement
Migrate Tax Sale Compass application from React/MongoDB to PHP/MySQL stack while maintaining all existing functionality including property search, interactive maps, user authentication, and admin capabilities.

## Testing Protocol
1. **Backend Testing First**: Always test backend endpoints using `deep_testing_backend_v2` before frontend testing
2. **Communication Protocol**: Update this file before and after each testing session
3. **Frontend Testing**: Use `auto_frontend_testing_agent` only after backend is verified and user confirms
4. **No Breaking Changes**: Maintain existing functionality during improvements
