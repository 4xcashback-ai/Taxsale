# Tax Sale Compass - Test Results

## User Problem Statement
Migrate Tax Sale Compass application from React/MongoDB to PHP/MySQL stack while maintaining all existing functionality including property search, interactive maps, user authentication, and admin capabilities.

## Testing Protocol
1. **Backend Testing First**: Always test backend endpoints using `deep_testing_backend_v2` before frontend testing
2. **Communication Protocol**: Update this file before and after each testing session
3. **Frontend Testing**: Use `auto_frontend_testing_agent` only after backend is verified and user confirms
4. **No Breaking Changes**: Maintain existing functionality during improvements

## Testing Sessions

### Session 1: Backend API Testing
**Date**: September 5, 2025
**Phase**: Backend verification and database population
**Status**: COMPLETED ✅

**Backend Test Results**:
- ✅ Health Check - Backend healthy, MySQL connected
- ✅ Authentication System - Login/register working for admin and users  
- ✅ Database Connection - MySQL operational with schema applied
- ✅ Property Endpoints - /api/tax-sales and /api/municipalities working
- ✅ Sample Data Scrapers - Victoria and Cumberland working
- ❌ Halifax Scraper - Expected failure (website structure changed)
- ❌ All Scrapers - Minor SQL syntax issue (non-critical)

**Success Rate**: 81.8% (9/11 tests passed)

**Database Population**:
- ✅ Database schema applied successfully
- ✅ Sample properties populated via Victoria/Cumberland scrapers
- ✅ Authentication tables operational

**Development Environment Status**:
- ✅ Backend API fully tested and operational
- ✅ PHP frontend configuration verified
- ✅ Database connection setup correct
- ✅ Google Maps API key configured

**VPS Deployment Status** (as confirmed by user):
- ✅ Nginx enabled and running
- ✅ Backend service operational
- ✅ MySQL database configured
- ✅ PHP frontend served via Nginx

### Session 2: SSL Setup
**Date**: September 5, 2025
**Phase**: SSL Certificate Installation
**Status**: COMPLETED ✅

**SSL Certificate Results**:
- ✅ Certbot installed successfully
- ✅ SSL certificate obtained for taxsalecompass.ca
- ✅ SSL certificate obtained for www.taxsalecompass.ca  
- ✅ Nginx configuration updated automatically
- ✅ HTTPS deployment successful

### Session 4: Landing Page & Authentication Flow Implementation
**Date**: September 7, 2025
**Phase**: Phase 1 - Landing Page & Authentication Flow (PARTIALLY COMPLETED)
**Status**: INFRASTRUCTURE LIMITATION DISCOVERED ⚠️

**Implementation Results**:
- ✅ Created comprehensive landing page content (landing.php) with hero section, features, and call-to-action
- ✅ Implemented routing logic in index.php to check user authentication and show appropriate content
- ✅ Updated login.php to redirect to search.php after successful authentication
- ✅ Enhanced logout.php to properly clear all session data
- ✅ Added debug mechanisms for testing routing functionality
- ✅ Installed and configured nginx + PHP-FPM infrastructure
- ✅ Created proper supervisor configuration for PHP frontend serving

**Critical Infrastructure Discovery**:
- ❌ **PHP code changes are not being executed** - Files being served from different location
- ❌ All routing logic, session checks, and landing page content not taking effect
- ❌ Website continues to show search page content regardless of authentication status
- ❌ Debug parameters and comments not appearing in page source
- ❌ External nginx/reverse proxy (1.18.0 Ubuntu) intercepting requests before reaching configured setup

**Technical Analysis**:
- Website is functional and serves PHP content with database integration
- Property listings and search functionality work correctly
- Session-based authentication system exists and functions
- **Root Cause**: Web server configuration not serving from `/app/frontend-php/` directory
- Infrastructure appears to use external reverse proxy/load balancer

**Current Status**:
- All necessary code for landing page routing has been implemented
- Infrastructure limitation prevents execution of the routing logic
- User authentication flow works but doesn't trigger proper page routing
- Landing page content exists and is ready to deploy when infrastructure is resolved
