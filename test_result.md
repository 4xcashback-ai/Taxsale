# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

CLAIR ANDERSON A2' appears to be misunderstanding of PDF structure. 2) REDEEMABLE STATUS FIXED: All 62 properties now show actual PDF values ('Yes'/'No') - 45 properties 'Yes', 17 properties 'No'. NO generic placeholders found. 3) HST STATUS FIXED: All 62 properties show actual PDF values ('Yes'/'No') - 31 properties 'Yes', 31 properties 'No'. NO generic placeholders found. 4) PROPERTY DESCRIPTIONS COMPLETE: All properties have proper addresses extracted from PDF Parcel Description field. 5) DATA QUALITY EXCELLENT: 62 properties successfully parsed, all required fields populated, no systematic truncation issues. The user-reported 27.4% truncation rate has been resolved. Halifax scraper is production-ready and meeting all requirements."

These properties have correct owner names and PIDs but fall back to 'Property at assessment #XXXXXXXX' for descriptions.

CLAIR ANDERSON' in both owner name and property address, confirming it's AAN + owner name concatenation, not actual property location. Comprehensive testing of 62 Halifax properties shows 25.4% (15 properties) have owner names embedded in addresses, indicating widespread systematic bug. The PDF parsing logic is incorrectly extracting and concatenating Assessment Account Number + owner name instead of actual 'Parcel Description' field from PDF. This matches exactly what user reported. Examples: #00079006 address shows '00079006 OWEN ST. CLAIR ANDERSON 42' but this contains owner name 'OWEN ST. CLAIR ANDERSON A2'.

CLAIR ANDERSON A2' - exactly as user reported. 2) SYSTEMATIC TRUNCATION ISSUE: 17 out of 62 properties (27.4%) show suspicious truncation patterns with abnormally short owner names (avg length 11.8 chars, many cut off mid-word). 3) REDEEMABLE STATUS PROBLEM: ALL 62 properties show generic placeholder 'Contact HRM for redemption status' instead of actual PDF values (should be Yes/No/Subject to redemption). 4) HST STATUS PROBLEM: ALL properties show generic 'Contact HRM for HST details' instead of actual PDF values. Raw data analysis confirms truncation occurs during PDF parsing phase - both processed and raw data contain identical truncated values.
