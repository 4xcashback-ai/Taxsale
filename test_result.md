# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"

## frontend:

##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"

##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Multi-PID Backend API Logic Fix"
##   stuck_tasks: []
##   test_all: false
##   test_priority: "high_first"
##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"
##     -message: "Fixed critical bbox format mismatch in multi-PID logic. Single-PID returns {minLon,maxLon,minLat,maxLat} but multi-PID tried to access {north,south,east,west}. Implemented bbox format conversion. Need testing for both single-PID (85010866) and multi-PID (85010866/85074276) requests to verify fix works correctly."

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

user_problem_statement: "Test if the statistics header shows correctly on both the landing page and the authenticated app after login. The user reported that the black statistics bar shows on the landing page but disappears when logging in. Need to verify: 1) Landing Page Statistics: Verify the dark statistics bar shows '3 Municipalities | 0 Active | 3 Inactive | 3 Total Properties | 0 Scraped Today | Last: 2025-09-03', 2) Login Process: Complete admin login (admin / TaxSale2025!SecureAdmin) successfully, 3) Authenticated App Statistics: After successful login, verify the same statistics header appears in the authenticated app, 4) Data Loading: Check if there are any timing issues where statistics data loads after the page renders, 5) Navigation Testing: Test if statistics header remains visible when switching between views (Search, Live Map, Admin). Expected Results: Statistics header should be identical on both landing page and authenticated app, statistics should show the same data values in both contexts, header should remain persistent across all authenticated views."

        comment: "STATISTICS HEADER BUG INVESTIGATION COMPLETED - ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED! The statistics header IS showing on both landing page and authenticated app, but displays different data due to filter behavior. DETAILED FINDINGS: 1) LANDING PAGE STATISTICS: Shows '3 Municipalities | 0 Active | 3 Inactive | 3 Total Properties | 0 Scraped Today | Last: 2025-09-03' - displays all properties regardless of status, 2) AUTHENTICATED APP STATISTICS: Shows '3 Municipalities | 0 Active | 0 Inactive | 0 Total Properties | 0 Scraped Today | Last: 2025-09-03' - defaults to 'Active' filter which shows 0 properties because all properties in system are 'inactive' status, 3) ROOT CAUSE: Authenticated app defaults to selectedStatus='active' but all 3 properties in database have status='inactive', so statistics header correctly shows 0 for all counts when filtered by active status, 4) NETWORK ANALYSIS: Landing page calls '/api/tax-sales?limit=8' (shows all properties), authenticated app calls '/api/tax-sales?status=active' (shows only active properties = 0), 5) STATISTICS HEADER WORKING CORRECTLY: Both components have identical statistics header implementation, the issue is data filtering not header display. SOLUTION NEEDED: Either change default filter in authenticated app from 'active' to 'all' or modify statistics calculation to show total counts regardless of current filter. The statistics header bug is actually a filter default behavior issue, not a missing header problem."
