# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

CLAIR ANDERSON A2' - exactly as user reported. 2) SYSTEMATIC TRUNCATION ISSUE: 17 out of 62 properties (27.4%) show suspicious truncation patterns with abnormally short owner names (avg length 11.8 chars, many cut off mid-word). 3) REDEEMABLE STATUS PROBLEM: ALL 62 properties show generic placeholder 'Contact HRM for redemption status' instead of actual PDF values (should be Yes/No/Subject to redemption). 4) HST STATUS PROBLEM: ALL properties show generic 'Contact HRM for HST details' instead of actual PDF values. Raw data analysis confirms truncation occurs during PDF parsing phase - both processed and raw data contain identical truncated values. The PDF parsing logic needs major fixes to: extract complete owner names without truncation, extract actual redeemable status from PDF text, extract actual HST status from PDF text. User's bug report is 100% accurate and validated."

    message: "SATELLITE THUMBNAIL IMAGES TESTING COMPLETED - CRITICAL API KEY ISSUE IDENTIFIED! Comprehensive testing of the newly implemented satellite thumbnail feature reveals the implementation is correct but not functional due to Google Maps Static API authentication failure. DETAILED TEST RESULTS: 1) IMPLEMENTATION VERIFICATION: All 62 property cards correctly display satellite thumbnail containers (128x128 pixels) with proper side-by-side flex layout, Google Maps Static API URLs generated correctly with proper parameters (center coordinates, zoom=18, size=128x128, maptype=satellite), network monitoring shows all satellite image requests being made with correct coordinates. 2) ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED: Google Maps Static API returns HTTP 403 Forbidden for all image requests, indicating API key authentication failure. The API key (AIzaSyACMb9WO0Y-f0-qNraOgInWvSdErwyrCdY) is either invalid, expired, or lacks Static Maps API permissions. 3) FALLBACK BEHAVIOR VERIFIED: All property cards correctly display fallback placeholder with satellite emoji (🛰️) and 'No Image' text when images fail to load, onError handler working as designed. 4) LAYOUT CONFIRMED: Side-by-side layout with thumbnail on left (128x128) and property content on right (flex-1) is working perfectly. 5) CODE QUALITY: Implementation follows taxsaleshub.ca reference design, proper error handling with graceful fallbacks, clean HTML structure with appropriate CSS classes. CONCLUSION: The satellite thumbnail feature is production-ready from a code perspective but requires a valid Google Maps Static API key to function. All 62 properties currently show fallback placeholders instead of actual satellite imagery due to API authentication failure."

    message: "BOUNDARY THUMBNAIL IMAGES CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE BUG DISCOVERED! Comprehensive testing of the boundary image system reveals a fundamental routing/proxy configuration issue preventing images from loading. DETAILED ANALYSIS: 1) BACKEND VERIFICATION: Boundary images exist at `/app/backend/static/property_screenshots/boundary_00424945_00079006.png` as valid PNG files (2865 bytes), boundary image API `/api/property/00079006/boundary-image` returns correct JSON with `has_boundary_image: true`, FastAPI static mount configured correctly with `app.mount('/static', StaticFiles(directory='/app/backend/static'))`. 2) FRONTEND VERIFICATION: Property cards correctly implement boundary image loading with proper error handling, property details pages correctly call boundary image API and attempt to load images, image elements created with correct URLs like `https://nstaxmap.preview.emergentagent.com/static/property_screenshots/boundary_00424945_00079006.png`. 3) CRITICAL ROUTING ISSUE IDENTIFIED: Static image URLs return `content-type: text/html; x-powered-by: Express` instead of image data, indicating requests are routed to frontend Express server instead of FastAPI backend, `/api/*` routes correctly go to FastAPI backend (uvicorn) but `/static/*` routes incorrectly go to frontend server. 4) IMPACT ASSESSMENT: All 62 property cards show 'Boundary Map' placeholders instead of actual boundary images, property details pages show 'Satellite image not available' instead of boundary images, image onError handlers trigger because HTML is returned instead of image data. SOLUTION REQUIRED: Fix infrastructure routing to send `/static/property_screenshots/*` requests to FastAPI backend where files exist, OR implement alternative serving method via `/api/` endpoints."
